# Seed Validator

## Our Vision

Seed Validator aims to maximize the potential of validators through:

- **Value-Added Validator Services**
  - Validators as funding mechanisms for startups
  - Validators as funding sources for non-profit organizations
  - Validators for improving application UX

- **Infrastructure Strengthening**
  - Leveraging our Japan-based position to promote Double Zero's IBRL in the Japanese market
  - Building robust and resilient validation infrastructure

- **Validator Ecosystem Optimization**
  - Encouraging decentralization by onboarding emerging validators
  - Active participation in governance of stake pools like Marinade

## Roadmap

### Short-term Goals
- Operate Seed Validator with high efficiency and reliability
- Onboard application and community-driven validators
- Participate in Marinade governance, focusing on auction mechanisms
- Contribute pull requests to improve existing protocols

### Mid-term Goals
- Support Double Zero's entry into the Japanese market
  - Lobbying efforts targeting companies with dark fiber infrastructure (e.g., NTT)
  - Supporting Japan-based validators in adapting to Double Zero requirements

### Long-term Goals
- Develop protocols that make it easier for application and community-driven validators to gain delegation
- Create sustainable validator ecosystems that benefit the entire blockchain network
